It would be neat to improve this project in a number of ways, for instance:

- Implement a simple web server for the end user where you could more easily (and intuitively) install cronjobs, designate settings like time frames for log deletion, create and manage access to the server and interface, etc.
- Graphically depict history of the number of unknown devices, the days/times a particular device is online, and more along these lines
- Create port-based profiles (using nmap) of unknown devices to better ID ones that may be constantly spoofing and changing their MACs and/or IPs
- Adjust this to run under a standard, non-root account

Unfortunately, I have  work and certifications that take precedence, so we'll have to see if I ever find the time and get around to it.
