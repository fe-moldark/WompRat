**WompRat** is a coffee-fueled project aimed at identifying and responding to unknown devices on your network. The tools integrate with your local DNS servers and routers' arp caches to automatically scan, identify and report right to your email.
<br><br>
This is in no way designed to replace proper network access controls, it's more a poor imitation aimed at least alerting on unknown devices if you're running a plug-and-play dhcp set up. The scripts are primarily written in bash with some python used for the email notifications. There are ways to white-list MACs, MAC vendors, set up alerts for devices, easily parse through log files for particular data, and more.
<br><br>
Last but not least, why the **WompRat** name? Well, you are kind of hunting for pests, or rogue devices, and I found the name amusing. Unfortunately, the `.com` domain was taken, so here we are at `.dev`. This was also my first time really scripting in bash, so it was certainly a learning experience and please forgive the no doubt numerous mistakes.

Enjoy a picture of a _lego_ Womp Rat now, since anything else was too hideous.
